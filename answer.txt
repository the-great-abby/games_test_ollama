Question: I would like to investigate the cursed witch, and learn if they are truly cursed.
==============================
 To investigate the cursed witch, you will need to gather information about her background, her alleged curse, and any potential leads or clues related to her supposed curse. Here's a suggested approach:
1. Gather Information: Use your contacts in the local community, especially those with knowledge of the supernatural, to learn what is known about the cursed witch. Ask around for rumors, legends, or facts that might help you understand her situation. You may need to use Persuasion, Intimidation, or Deception skills to extract information from reluctant sources.
2. Interview Witnesses: Talk to people who have seen the witch or who live near her dwelling. Ask them about her behavior before and after the supposed curse took effect, any unusual occurrences they've noticed, and their personal beliefs regarding curses and witches. Use active listening skills and follow up questions to gather as much detail as possible.
3. Inspect the Witch's Dwelling: If it is safe to do so, visit the witch's home and search for any signs of supernatural activity or clues related to her curse. Look for strange symbols, objects, or rituals that might be connected to the curse. Use your Herbalist or Survival skills if necessary to identify any unusual plants or animals in the area.
4. Consult Experts: Seek out local experts on the supernatural, such as priests, priestesses, or herbalists, for their opinions and guidance. They might have additional knowledge about curses or the specific type of curse that is said to afflict the witch. Use your Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (Religion), or Lore skills to gather information from these experts.
5. Research: Read any available texts on curses, witches, and the supernatural in general. Use your Lore skill to find relevant books in local libraries, temples, or other repositories of knowledge. Look for patterns or commonalities between different types of curses and see if they apply to the situation with the cursed witch.
6. Use Your Senses: Pay close attention to any unusual sensations, smells, sounds, or sights that you encounter during your investigation. Trust your instincts and use your Perception skill to notice even the smallest details that might be relevant to the case.
7. Consider Alternative Explanations: Be open-minded about alternative explanations for the witch's alleged curse. For example, she could be suffering from a medical condition or experiencing a mental health issue rather than being genuinely cursed. Use your Insight skill to assess the situation and come up with the most plausible explanation.
8. Confront the Witch: If it is safe to do so, confront the witch directly and ask her about the curse. Use tact and diplomacy when speaking to her, as she may be defensive or fearful. Be prepared for her to deny the curse or to offer an explanation that you had not considered before.
9. Follow Up on Leads: If you come across any new leads or information during your investigation, follow up on them to learn more about the situation with the cursed witch. Use your Persuasion, Intimidation, or Deception skills as necessary to extract additional details from reluctant sources.
10. Document Your Findings: Keep detailed notes of everything you've learned during your investigation, including any new leads or information that comes to light. This will help you in the future if you need to revisit this case or if you come across similar situations.
